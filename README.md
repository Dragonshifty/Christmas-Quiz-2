Annual Christmas Quiz, created in Unity. 

- 3D environment with NPCs wandering around a Christmas town and featuring assets (characters) that I've modelled in Blender, as well as pre-made assets.
- Users can input their own questions, which are then saved to JSON and randomised at Quiz Time.
- Each answer triggers a player charcter animation (MIXAMO as I ran out of time to properly rig and animate in Blender)
- Christmas music player

Player modelled in Blender (based on course):
